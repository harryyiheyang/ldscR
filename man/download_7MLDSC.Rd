\title{Download 7M SNP LD Score Reference Panels}
\source{
LD reference panels computed using SBayesRC methodology from:
\url{https://github.com/zhilizheng/SBayesRC}

Based on UK Biobank imputed genotype data with ~7 million common SNPs,
providing enhanced LD estimation compared to sparse reference panels.
}
\usage{
download_7MLDSC(ancestry)
}
\arguments{
\item{ancestry}{Character string specifying which LD reference to download.
Options: "EUR", "EAS", "AFR", "EURxEAS", "EURxAFR", "EASxAFR"}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. The function loads data directly into the global environment:
  \item{SevenMillon_[ancestry]LDSC}{Data frame with LD scores for the requested ancestry}
  \item{SevenMillon_SNP}{Data frame with SNP information (loaded once per session)}
}
\description{
Downloads LD Score reference panels computed from UK Biobank imputed data
containing approximately 7 million SNPs. These panels are derived from the
SBayesRC project which provides high-density LD reference data for multiple
ancestries and cross-population combinations.

The LD reference panels include:
\itemize{
  \item Single ancestry panels: EUR, EAS, AFR computed from UK Biobank
        samples of respective ancestries using ~7M imputed SNPs
  \item Cross-population panels: EURxEAS, EURxAFR, EASxAFR computed by
        combining LD information across ancestry groups
  \item SNP information file (7m_snp.parquet) containing SNP identifiers
        and allele information for harmonization
}

These high-density panels improve polygenic prediction accuracy compared to
traditional HapMap3-based references by leveraging the full spectrum of
common variation captured by modern imputation.
}
\details{
The function downloads parquet files from a remote server and loads them
directly into the global environment using assign(). The SNP information
file is only downloaded once per session to avoid redundant transfers.

File sizes are substantial (~500MB-1GB each) due to the high SNP density.
Ensure adequate internet connection and disk space.
